## Growth of $1

Note that the plotFunc and inputs are prefaced with !r, which indicates that the value is an R expression rather than a literal value.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
makePlot1()
```

This plot took reactive inputs from a FlexDashboard in which the user chose risk level:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
input$risktolerance
```
