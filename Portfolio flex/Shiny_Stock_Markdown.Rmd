## Test

Note that the plotFunc and inputs are prefaced with !r, which indicates that the value is an R expression rather than a literal value.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
params$plotFunc()
```

This plot took reactive inputs from a FlexDashboard in which the user chose a percentage allocation to stocks of:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
params$weight1
```

And chose these dates
```{r, echo=FALSE}
params$date1

params$date2
```
